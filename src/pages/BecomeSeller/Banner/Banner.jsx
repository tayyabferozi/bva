        Hundreds of companies, webshops, and brands use BVA Auctions as an
        (additional) sales channel these days. Their warehouse is full of
        overstock, dormant stock or second-hand products etc. By using an extra
        sales channel - with a customer base of{" "}
        <strong>2.4 million potential buyers</strong> - you quickly increase the
        turnover rate! And get maximum sales.
